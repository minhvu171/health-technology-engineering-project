This repository contains the code file of a project that I completed during the course "Introduction to Biomedical Informatics".

The code file is part of a project called "GENETIC VARIANTS REGARDING LONG QT SYNDROME". The focus of this project is to examine the relationship between genetic variants related to the ANK2 gene and QT interval prolongation. More particularly, the project aimed to answer “Are certain genetic variants in the ANK2 gene significantly associated with QT interval prolongation?” and “Is there a measurable difference in QT intervals among individuals with different ANK2 genotypes?”. By studying genotype data and corresponding QT interval measurements from ECG data, we aim to determine whether specific ANK2 variants are associated with prolonged QT intervals.

The code file has functions that load the ECG data of patients, filter the ECG signal, calculate the average QT intervals of each patient, extract the QT intervals based on different genotypes, and perform the ANOVA test.

The majority of the code file is done by the course staff. From my side, I studied and understood how to utilize each function to obtain the needed results, for example, the visualization of the ECG signal of a patient in a particular period.
